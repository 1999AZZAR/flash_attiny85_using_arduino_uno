# ATtiny85 Fade Example

A hardware PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) example demonstrating smooth LED brightness control without blocking the CPU.

## Description
This program creates a "breathing" effect on an LED connected to **PB0**. Unlike the Blink example which uses simple delays, this example configures the ATtiny85's internal **Timer0** peripheral to generate a PWM signal.

## Hardware Connection

| ATtiny85 Pin | Component |
|---|---|
| **Pin 5 (PB0)** | LED Anode (+) (via 220Ω Resistor) |
| **Pin 4 (GND)** | LED Cathode (-) |
| **Pin 8 (VCC)** | 2.7V - 5.5V Power Source |

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Hardware PWM
The LED is driven by **Timer0** in Fast PWM mode.
*   **`TCCR0A`**: Configured for "Clear on Compare Match".
*   **`OCR0A`**: The Output Compare Register determines the duty cycle (brightness).
*   **Efficiency**: The PWM signal is generated by dedicated hardware. The CPU is only needed to update the `OCR0A` value every few milliseconds, leaving it free 99% of the time.

### 2. Smooth Transitions
The main loop increments and decrements the brightness value (0-255) to create a linear fade effect.
